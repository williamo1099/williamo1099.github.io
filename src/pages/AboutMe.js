            Ever since I was a kid, I was always fascinated by how my dad's
            computer could be really <em>smart</em> and curious about how people
            made it that <em>smart</em>. Long story short, I made it as a
            bachelor majoring in computer science at Parahyangan Catholic
            University. There I learnt a lot of new things about programming, a
            way of making a computer <em>smart</em>. I built a number of
            softwares and applications for several objectives. In addition, I
            learnt a few about data science. Therefore for my thesis, I built a
            software for clustering a bunch of documents by content using a
            clustering algorithm.

            &hellip;And it did <em>not</em> stop there. I continue learning a
            lot of new stuffs that was never learnt during my college years.
            Over time, I learn and everytime I finish learning about one thing,
            I always build a new personal project as a pass for myself. Along
            with that, I always keep my codes <em>clean</em> and organized as
            well as safely store them in my GitHub. Well, that's all for this
            little story about me as a&nbsp;
            <span className="text-primary">junior programmer</span> and how it
            all started. And I hope this is going to be a new and fun beginning
            to my journey as a programmer.
