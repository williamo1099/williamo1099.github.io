              Ever since I was a kid, I was always fascinated by how my dad's
              computer could be really <em>smart</em> and curious about how
              people made it that <em>smart</em>. Long story short, I made it as
              a bachelor majoring in computer science at{" "}
              <a href="https://unpar.ac.id" target="_blank">
                Parahyangan Catholic University
              </a>
              . There I learnt lots of stuffs about programming and how people
              actually make a computer <em>smart</em>. I built a number of
              softwares for many projects and various objectives. Along with
              that, I took a few bit of knowledge about data science. Therefore
              for my thesis, I built a software with an objective of clustering
              a bunch of documents by their contents using a clustering
              algorithm.
            </h5>

            <h5 className="h5 my-2">
              &hellip;And it did <em>not</em> stop there. It continues with me
              learning lots of new stuffs about some of the latest programming
              tools and technologies. Over time I learn and to conclude my study
              about one thing, I build a personal project as a pass for myself.
              Speaking of my programming habits, I always keep my codes{" "}
              <em>clean</em> and organized as well as safely store them in my
              GitHub. Well, that's all for this little story about me as a
              junior programmer and how it all started. And I hope this is going
              to be a new and fun beginning to my journey as a programmer.
